# Quality Gate

Pass all checks before returning final design output.

## A. Direction Integrity

- Confirm one primary art direction is declared.
- Confirm one visual motif appears in at least three UI areas.
- Confirm a short rationale ties visual choices to product goals.

## B. Token Discipline

- Confirm a token set exists (type, spacing, radius, border, color roles).
- Confirm at least 2 heading sizes and 2 body sizes with explicit usage rules.
- Confirm accent colors are role-based (`accent`, `success`, `warning`) rather than arbitrary.

## C. Layout Quality

- Confirm desktop and mobile hierarchy differ where needed.
- Confirm at least one section intentionally breaks grid rhythm.
- Confirm background treatment is purposeful (not a flat default fill unless justified).

## D. Interaction and Motion

- Confirm motion has meaning (hierarchy reveal, feedback, or transition logic).
- Confirm no decorative animation without UX purpose.
- Confirm hover/focus/pressed states are visible and consistent.

## E. Anti-Generic Sweep

- Reject if output looks like a default template with minor color swaps.
- Reject if typography is generic or lacks contrast in voice.
- Reject if all sections share the same container/card pattern.
- Reject if the UI can be mistaken for "AI-generated boilerplate" at first glance.
