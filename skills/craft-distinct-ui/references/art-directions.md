# Art Directions

Pick one primary direction. Add at most one secondary accent.

## 1) Editorial Contrast

- Use case: Story-heavy landing pages, portfolio-like product pages.
- Typography: `Space Grotesk` for UI + `Newsreader` for display accents.
- Palette: Neutral base + one deep accent (`#0F172A`) + one warm highlight (`#C2410C`).
- Layout: Large headlines, asymmetric columns, strong section separators.
- Motif: Thin rule lines and oversized quote or metric blocks.

## 2) Precision Minimal

- Use case: B2B SaaS dashboards, analytics UI, settings-heavy apps.
- Typography: `Sora` + `IBM Plex Sans`.
- Palette: Gray technical base + electric blue accent (`#2563EB`) + mint state color (`#10B981`).
- Layout: Tight grid, explicit alignment, low-noise backgrounds.
- Motif: Subtle grid overlays or crosshair markers in key panels.

## 3) Soft Neo-Brutal

- Use case: Creative tools, early-stage product marketing.
- Typography: `General Sans` + `Cabinet Grotesk`.
- Palette: Bright canvas + ink text + one punch color (`#EF4444` or `#0EA5E9`).
- Layout: High contrast blocks, bold strokes, slightly offset layers.
- Motif: 2px-3px borders, lifted cards, hard-edged badges.

## 4) Warm Productized

- Use case: Consumer product pages, onboarding-heavy apps.
- Typography: `Manrope` + `Fraunces`.
- Palette: Warm neutrals + grounded green (`#166534`) + amber support (`#D97706`).
- Layout: Spacious flow, rounded geometry, clear feature narrative.
- Motif: Soft gradient bands and tactile surfaces with restrained shadows.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not mix 3+ art directions in one page.
- Do not apply gradients to everything.
- Do not use identical card styles for every section.
- Do not keep the same spacing rhythm across all blocks.
- Do not choose colors before typography and layout intent are fixed.
